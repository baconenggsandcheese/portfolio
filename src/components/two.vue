        >Hi! I'm Aninda I like creating lean and clean websites which are both
        easy and fast to use.
        <br />
        I optimise for both aesthetics and performance.
        <br />
        <br />
        Something which results in a really good looking site that is easy and
        good to use.
        <br />
        I am The interest of doing something different drove me to an idea of
        working in the field of computer science engineering and I came up with
        an idea for an open-source AI library which can be used for NPCS which
        then could be implemented in different games. It would significantly
        help Indie game developers or anyone who wants to develop their own
        game. It took me almost a year to figure out ‘how will it happen’. A lot
        of work needs to be done as current AI libraries for advanced AIs are
        getting patented which results in a problem of implementing already
        available good methods.
